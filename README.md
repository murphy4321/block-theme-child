# block-theme-child-1 - Navbar modularization (Vite)

This folder contains a modularized version of your Squarespace navbar script adapted for a WordPress child theme named **block-theme-child-1**.
The project is configured to use **Vite**. Run `npm install` then `npm run dev` for development or `npm run build` to produce `/dist/assets/main.js`.

**Important:** Replace `src/data/customMenus.js` with your real menu data (I included a sample/placeholder). See instructions in that file.
